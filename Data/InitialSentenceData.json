    "Senteca": "Just because something doesn’t do what you planned it to do doesn’t mean it’s useless."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Our technology forces us to live mythically."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology is a word that describes something that doesn’t work yet."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "All this modern technology just makes people try to do everything at once."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Humanity is acquiring all the right technology for all the wrong reasons."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "It’s supposed to be automatic, but actually you have to push this button."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Books may look like nothing more than words on a page, but they are actually an infinitely complex imaginotransference technology that translates odd, inky squiggles into pictures inside your head."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "I think that novels that leave out technology misrepresent life as badly as Victorians misrepresented life by leaving out sex."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Devices are not dangerous for literature. People can be dangerous for literature. People, for example, who do not read."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards."

    "Senteca": "Old robots are becoming more human and young humans are becoming more like robots."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology… the knack of so arranging the world that we don’t have to experience it."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology frightens me to death. It’s designed by engineers to impress other engineers. And they always come with instruction booklets that are written by engineers for other engineers – which is why almost no technology ever works."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "The great myth of our times is that technology is communication."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology made large populations possible; large populations now make technology indispensable."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "TV and the Internet are good because they keep stupid people from spending too much time out in public."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "This is the whole point of technology. It creates an appetite for immortality on the one hand. It threatens universal extinction on the other. Technology is lust removed from nature."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "The greatest achievement of humanity is not its works of art, science, or technology, but the recognition of its own dysfunction."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "We now expect more from technology and less from each other."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII – and we thought it was a typewriter. Then we discovered graphics, and we thought it was a television. With the World Wide Web, we’ve realized it’s a brochure."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Communications tools don’t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic."

  {
    "Senteca": "The role of the artist today is to defend feeling against the machine."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "For a list of all the ways technology has failed to improve the quality of life, please press three."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "As a technology, the book is like a hammer. That is to say, it is perfect: a tool ideally suited to its task. Hammers can be tweaked and varied but will never go obsolete. Even when builders pound nails by the thousand with pneumatic nail guns, every household needs a hammer."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "The ultimate promise of technology is to make us master of a world that we command by the push of a button."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "I might love my e-reader, but I’d never pass up the chance to browse real books."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Once a new technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Hardware: the parts of a computer that can be kicked."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology presumes there’s just one right way to do things and there never is."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Getting information off the Internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology has to be invented or adopted."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "We don’t need nukes. We have the internet."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Technology… is a queer thing. It brings you great gifts with one hand, and it stabs you in the back with the other."
  },
  {
    "Senteca": "Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork."
